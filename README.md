# Algorithms that operate on Presentations for Finite Groups

Group Theory is an elegant field of mathematics, dealing with notions of
symmetry in all structures of mathematics.

A fundamental structure for a finitely generated group is its *presentation*. A presentation is a compact structure that describes the way that groups are built, and how they are shaped. I think that the most elegant view of a presentation is the way that they are shaped. In this library, I will present some algorithms showing how groups are shaped.

This will allow me to build some amazing groups, illuminating structures that reveal properties about everything in mathematics.
